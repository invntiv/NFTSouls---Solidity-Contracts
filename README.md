# NFTSouls pre-alpha demo - SOLIDITY PORTION

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
This is a pre-alpha version of an upcoming dark fantasy, RPG-inspired NFT project. 

We want to bring some of our favorite aspects of Role-playing games- the worldbuilding/lore, and the loot- onto the blockchain!
One of our favorite parts of playing a new game is picking up each new piece of loot and reading the item description. A narrative starts to unfold as you slowly piece it together from flavor text here and there...

What if we could crowdsource a world, the characters in it, and the story that way? And what if the items were NFTs that you could own forever? And what if once that world was fleshed out, we could use what the community created as the backbone for a game where you could see the story you helped create?

We are planning to utilize artistic Non-Fungible Tokens for worldbuilding, along with a custom fungible ERC token called $LORE to create one of the world's first crowdsourced intellectual properties! Owners of the NFT items will be airdropped $LORE, which can be used to submit new item descriptions and vote for the best lore on each item. The description with the most votes will be minted with that item's artwork into the finalized NFT

### Roadmap

#### Planning and Design
- [ ] Decide on NFT artistic style (balance design speed with visual style. Realism takes too long, but we want to portray a darker vibe)
- [ ] Set up Discord
- [ ] Social media accounts
- [ ] Design and write a Litepaper to communicate our vision, generate hype, and explain our development roadmap
- [ ] Long-term, sky is the limit! 

#### Front-end and features
- [ ] Finalize color palette, style
- [ ] Add Litepaper
- [ ] Collection display
- [ ] Lore submission feature
- [ ] Lore upvote feature

#### Web3 / back-end
- [x] Metamask login
- [x] Minting pseudo-random NFTs
- [ ] other wallet integrations?
- [ ] Integrate Chainlink VRF for true randomness
- [ ] Minting via Polygon for lower gas?
- [ ] Smart contract - add post-mint trade commission
- [ ] Whitelisting: raffle allows for increased fairness
- [ ] Learn how to do airdrops (should be fairly trivial to mint and send ERC token to a list of owner addresses)
- [ ] $LORE token
- [ ] DAO functionality; submitting new Lore, voting on other users will cost $Lore



# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
